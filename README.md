# VectorPath 2D Cipher 🚀🔐

**VectorPath 2D Cipher** is a web-based 2D encoding and decoding tool that uses a bulletproof fixed-width 2-digit protocol to securely transform text. The tool allows users to encode plain text into a custom numeric pattern and decode it back to readable text.

- 🔄 Decode numeric patterns back into the original text.  
- 🅰️ Supports:
  - Uppercase and lowercase letters  
  - Numbers  
  - Common symbols  
  - Spaces, tabs, and newlines

### 🛠 How It Works

**Encoding Logic:**
- 🔺 Letters A-M are converted using a sequential increment pattern.  
- 🔻 Letters N-Z are converted using a decrement pattern.  
- 🔢 Numbers are mapped to a fixed numeric sequence.  
- ⚙️ Symbols are mapped to a custom numeric range.  
- ⬜ Spaces, tabs, and newlines have specific 2-digit codes.  

**Decoding Logic:**
- 🔄 The numeric patterns are parsed and converted back to their original characters.  
- ✅ Handles lowercase/uppercase, numbers, symbols, and whitespace correctly.  
- ❓ Invalid patterns are detected and returned as `?`.

### 📖 How to Use
1. 📝 Input your text in the "Input Stream" text area.  
2. 🟢 Click **Encode Data** to generate the numeric pattern.  
3. 🔵 Click **Decode Stream** to convert a numeric pattern back to text.  
4. 🧹 Click **Clear All** to reset the input and output.  
5. 📋 Click **Copy** to copy the output to your clipboard.
